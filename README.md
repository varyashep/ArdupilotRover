|   Vcc+GND  |  Power module output  |

This rover is made on a tracked platform so both motors are set for driving. Since we needed our rover to work correctly in auto and guided modes, we've decided to set MOT_PWM_TYPE to BrushedWithBipolar (all the parameters listed below).
This motor type allows us to handle every relay state correctly. 

RC sticks mode is set to 1. By setting RCMAP parameters (listed below) we've managed to use only 1 stick (right one). These can vary depending on your transmitter.

RCMAP_PITCH,3

RCMAP_ROLL,4
<br/>
RCMAP_THROTTLE,2

RCMAP_YAW,1

In Mission Planner upload the RoverCode.lua script to the scripts folder and reboot the Pixhawk. 

### Code Details

Left and right motor receive values from SERVO channels 2 and 4 (73 and 74 stand for Throttle Left and Throttle Right respectively) using SRV_Channels:get_ouput_pwm function. 

Since Trim is set to 1500, that's the value when relays are off. If value is more or less than 1500, rover moves either back or forward.
